 Numeric matrix transformation algorithms
   So far available:
    
   Work in progress:
 - Gauss-Elimination (solving linear system of equasions and Gauss for matrix)
 - LU, LDL
 - In case of Symmetry: LDL^T, Cholensky
 - QR
 - Householder-transformation

Code written in Java, using Visual Studio Code.
